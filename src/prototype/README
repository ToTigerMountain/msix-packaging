IMPORTANT: This is a prototype that will hopefully be obliterated and re-implemented at some point in life

Currently creates a msix package for windows and macos (probably linux too)

Takes a dependency on zlib, xerces and openssl (only for non-win).

Usage: prototype.exe <folder to pack>
Output: placeholder.msix 

TODOs:
- Verify builds and works on Linux
- Add output package name in command line option
- Make it pretty(ier)
