IMPORTANT: This is a prototype that will hopefully be obliterated and re-implemented at some point in life

Currently packs for windows. Non-Windows platforms soon...

Takes a dependency on zlib, xerces and openssl (not yet).


Usage: prototype.exe <folder to pack>
Output: placeholder.msix

TODOs:
- Implement base64 encoding using openssl or handrolled
- Verify builds and works on non-windows platforms
- Add output package name in command line option
- Make it pretty
